# EDA of Traffic Accidents in Madrid (2019-2023)
Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jairoordezpacheco/accidentes-de-trfico-de-madrid-espaa-2019-a-2023

### Analysis Approach
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted in three main stages:

1. Data cleaning, formatting, and standardization of the traffic accident dataset.
2. Summarization and visualization of key variables to identify trends and patterns for further analysis.
3. Temporal pattern analysis to explore accident distribution across different hours, days, and months (time series analysis).

## Summary of Key Insights
1. Accidents are more frequent in densely populated districts such as Puente de Vallecas and Salamanca.

2. Most accidents involve private cars and motorcycles, with frontal-lateral and rear-end collisions being the most common types.

3. Weather conditions do not significantly influence accident occurrence, as most accidents happen under clear weather.

4. The majority of victims are men aged 25-49 years old.

5. Alcohol and drugs do not appear to be strongly associated with recorded accidents, based on available data.

6. Traffic accidents peak in the evening hours (18:00-19:00), especially on Fridays.

7. COVID-19 lockdowns had a clear impact on accident trends in 2020, with a gradual recovery in subsequent years.


## Key Findings
### General Trends
Districts with the Highest Number of Traffic Accidents:
1. Puente de Vallecas
2. Salamanca
3. Chamart√≠n
4. Ciudad Lineal
5. Carabanchel

### Most Common Types of Accidents
1. Frontal-lateral collision
2. Rear-end collision
3. Side collision
4. Collision with a fixed obstacle

### Weather Conditions
The majority of accidents occurred under clear weather conditions, suggesting that weather did not play a significant role in accident occurrence.

### Most Affected Vehicle Types
Passenger cars ("Turismo"), 125cc motorcycles, and vans ("Furgoneta") were the most frequently involved vehicle types in accidents.

### Injury Severity Data
The available data on injury severity was not particularly useful due to its low coverage. In most cases, injury severity was not recorded, limiting its analytical value.

### Age Groups of Accident Victims
The most affected age group ranged from 25 to 49 years old, with a clear underrepresentation of children and elderly individuals.

### Gender Distribution
A higher proportion of accident victims were men.

### Alcohol and Drug Tests
The dataset showed no strong correlation between alcohol or drug consumption and accident occurrence, as most recorded cases did not involve positive test results.

## Time Series Analysis
This part of the analysis revealed meaningful patterns in accident frequency over time.

### Yearly Trends
- The highest number of traffic accidents was recorded in 2019, followed by 2023.
- A significant drop in accidents occurred in 2020, likely due to mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- From 2021 onwards, accident numbers increased gradually.

### Monthly Trends
The three months with the highest accident counts were October, November, and December.

### Weekly Trends
- Fridays had the highest number of accidents, followed by Thursdays, Wednesdays, and Tuesdays.
- Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays recorded the lowest accident frequencies.

Hourly Trends
- The peak accident hours were 19:00, 18:00, and 14:00, which likely correlate with school schedules and end-of-work hours.
- Hourly patterns by day of the week:
    1. Fridays: Showed an overall increase in accidents from 13:00 to 21:00, with a peak between 14:00 and 15:00.
    2. Tuesday to Thursday: Accidents were more concentrated between 18:00 and 21:00, followed by a gradual decline in the 12:00 to 17:00 and 08:00 to 09:00 time slots.
